\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:summary}

We structure the conclusion as a mirror of the research question addressed in Introduction


\section{How do the empirical parameters for the flow resistance and the heat transfer used in current modelling compare to in situ measurements of an ice-dammed lakes drainage?}


\section{What is the spatial and temporal distribution of outburst floods from water pocket in the Swiss Alps?}

\section{What are the drivers and mechanism for the formation and the rupture of water pockets?}

\section{What are the limitation of ground penetrating radar on the detection of englacial water bodies in temperate ice?}
