In this study I contributed to update the water pocket outburst floods inventory, performed the data analysis, produced the figures (with contribution from Dorde Masovic) and wrote the article. 

\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}


        \item  Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are typically associated with visible surface or marginal lakes (see Chapter \ref{ch:chapter_plainemorte}), leaving a significant gap in understanding events originating from hidden water reservoirs within or beneath glaciers, termed water pockets.

        \item Despite Haeberli's pioneering work on WPOFs in the Swiss Alps, defining and studying water pockets remains challenging, with ambiguity in distinguishing them from other types of glacier floods.

        \item Our study aims to fill this gap by compiling a comprehensive database of WPOFs in the Swiss Alps and analyzing their characteristics

        \item We seek to improve water pocket characterization, laying the groundwork for future research in water pocket prediction
